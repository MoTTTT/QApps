This repo contains working artefacts for the dev, test and build of a kubernetes cluster and its workload.

Requirements, specification, design, and build notes have been moved to the podzone repo, and will be served as part of the deliverable on docs.podzone.net.

The deployment artefacts are packaged as helm charts.
